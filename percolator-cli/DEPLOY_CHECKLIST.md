# Pre-Production Deployment Checklist

Five suites verify the protocol on-chain against v12.21. All require
`SOLANA_RPC_URL` in `.env`. Devnet rent is ~10.6 SOL per slab and is NOT
reclaimable on v12.21 (the `unsafe_close` feature was removed).

```bash
# 1. Preflight — 92 checks, 25 sections, 3 market types
npx tsx tests/preflight.ts                     # ~32 SOL (3 slabs)

# 2. Live state verification — 79 checks across 7 sections
npx tsx scripts/live-verify.ts                 # ~10.6 SOL (1 slab)

# 3. Maintenance-fee 50/50 keeper-reward sweep — 12 checks
npx tsx scripts/check-maint-fees.ts            # ~10.6 SOL (1 slab)

# 4. Authority rotation/burn coverage — 21 checks (4 kinds × all paths)
npx tsx scripts/check-authorities.ts           # ~10.6 SOL (1 slab)

# 5. Stress: bankruptcy + ADL + bank run — invariants asserted at every phase
npx tsx scripts/stress-bankrun.ts              # ~10.6 SOL (1 slab)

# 6. Unit tests — offline, no SOL needed
pnpm test
```

## v12.21 caveats

- **`MAX_ACCRUAL_DT_SLOTS = 100`** (engine-level, ~40 sec). All multi-step
  flows must refresh the mark and crank between health-sensitive ops or
  the next call returns `CatchupRequired` (0x1d). Single-shot tests are
  unaffected.
- **§1.4 envelope** at init: `min_liquidation_abs` MUST be much smaller
  than `min_nonzero_mm_req` or the wrapper rejects with `EngineOverflow`
  (0x12). Defaults: `min_liquidation_abs=10_000`, `min_nonzero_mm_req=100_000`.
- **Anti-spam invariant**: `new_account_fee == 0 AND maintenance_fee_per_slot == 0`
  is rejected. Set at least one nonzero.
- **Hyperp price-move cap**: `max_price_move_bps_per_slot=2` clamps how
  fast `engine.last_oracle_price` can step. Full-size closing trades on
  Hyperp markets that haven't been cranked recently can trip the cap and
  return `OracleInvalid` (0x0c). Workaround: refresh + crank between
  trades to keep the per-slot move budget non-zero.
- **`SetOraclePriceCap` (tag 18) deleted**. The cap is init-immutable
  via `RiskParams.max_price_move_bps_per_slot`.

|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| InitMarket fields | Config/params spot-checked | **Every field at exact value** |
