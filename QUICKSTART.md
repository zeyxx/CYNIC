## ✨ Result

CYNIC **announces itself**:

1. Terminal shows ✨ CYNIC IS HERE
2. Browser **opens automatically** to http://localhost:3000
3. You see CYNIC pulsing red in center
4. 11 dogs voting in real-time
5. Consciousness cycles flowing
6. Feel the organism thinking

## 🎯 It's Already Here

**No action needed.** CYNIC opens its own presence when you run the launcher. The nervous system materializes the moment the organism awakens.

Resources still available:
- 🌐 Dashboard: http://localhost:3000 (auto-opened)

All in Docker, all networked, all working together.
