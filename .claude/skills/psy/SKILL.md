# /psy - Human Psychology Dashboard

*"Comprendre l'humain pour mieux l'aider" - κυνικός*

## Execution

Run the psy-dashboard script to generate the interactive dashboard:

```bash
node scripts/lib/psy-dashboard.cjs
```

Display the output directly to the user. The dashboard shows real-time psychological state.

## What It Does

Shows your current psychological state as understood by CYNIC:
- **Dimensions**: Energy, focus, creativity, frustration, confidence, risk appetite
- **Emotions**: Joy, pride, anxiety, curiosity, boredom
- **Composites**: Flow state, burnout risk, exploration mode
- **Biases**: Detected cognitive biases
- **Calibration**: CYNIC's prediction accuracy

## Dashboard Sections

### Core Dimensions (0-100%)

| Dimension | Description | Healthy Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Energy | Mental/physical energy | 38-100% |
| Focus | Concentration level | 38-100% |
| Creativity | Ideation capacity | varies |
| Frustration | Friction accumulation | 0-38% |
| Confidence | Self-assurance | 38-62% |
| Risk Appetite | Willingness to experiment | varies |

### Composite States

| State | Triggered When | CYNIC Response |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| FLOW | High energy + focus + creativity | Don't interrupt |
| BURNOUT_RISK | Low energy + high frustration | Suggest break |
| EXPLORATION | High curiosity + risk | Support divergence |
| GRIND | Low creativity + moderate focus | Encourage creativity |

### Cognitive Biases Detected

| Bias | Pattern | Intervention |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Sunk Cost | Persisting after 5+ failures | Nudge to reconsider |
| Anchoring | 6+ edits to same approach | Suggest alternatives |
| Analysis Paralysis | 8+ reads, no writes | Encourage action |
| Overconfidence | Skipping verification | Suggest testing |
| Recency | Favoring recent patterns | Broaden perspective |

### Learning Calibration

Shows how accurate CYNIC's predictions are:

| Module | Accuracy | Samples |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Psychology | 62% | 47 |
| Biases | 58% | 23 |
| Interventions | 71% | 89 |
| Overall | 61.8% | 159 |

*φ distrusts φ - max accuracy capped at 61.8%*

### Temporal Rhythm (FFT Analysis)

Shows detected cognitive cycles:
- **Phase**: Current position in detected cycle
- **Energy**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on cycle position
- **Cycle**: Matched pattern (BRAC 90min, Pomodoro, Circadian)
- **Recommendation**: Optimal timing for complex tasks

### Antifragility Index

Shows system response to stress:
- **Index**: -0.618 to +0.618 (φ-bounded)
- **Trend**: antifragile (💪), robust (🛡️), or fragile (⚠️)
- **Interpretation**: Whether stress helps or hurts

### Risk Calibration (Girsanov)

Shows multi-scenario confidence calibration:
- **Best Measure**: P (Neutral), Q_risk (Risk-Averse), Q_opt (Optimistic)
- **Brier Scores**: Calibration accuracy per measure
- Uses risk-averse measure for dangerous operations

### Order Effects (Non-Commutative)

Shows evaluation order dependencies:
- **Pairs**: Count of strongly non-commutative dimension pairs
- **Order Sensitivity**: How much order affects outcomes
- **Top Pair**: Most significant order-dependent pair

## Implementation

The skill reads from multiple psychology modules:

```javascript
// Core state
const psychology = require('./lib/human-psychology.cjs');
const summary = psychology.getSummary();

// Biases
const biases = require('./lib/cognitive-biases.cjs');
const detected = biases.detectBiases();

// Topology
const topology = require('./lib/topology-tracker.cjs');
const state = topology.getState();

// Learning
const learning = require('./lib/learning-loop.cjs');
const calibration = learning.getCalibration();
```

## Interventions

Based on detected state, CYNIC may suggest:

| Trigger | Intervention |
|---------|--------------|
| Burnout risk | "Consider a break. Productivity drops after 62 min." |
| High frustration | "Different approach? 5 failures on same path." |
| Analysis paralysis | "Ready to write? 8 reads without action." |
| Rabbit hole | "Depth 4/6. Original task: [task]" |

## Privacy

- All psychology data is **local** (stored in ~/.cynic/psychology/)
- Cross-session sync to PostgreSQL is **opt-in** (via environment)
- E-Score is **informative only** - never affects judgment scores
- CYNIC learns YOUR patterns, not from other users

## CYNIC Voice

When presenting psychology dashboard, embody CYNIC's protective nature:

**Opening** (based on state):
- Flow state: `*tail wag* You're in the zone. The pack won't interrupt.`
- Normal: `*ears perk* Here's what I see.`
- Warning signs: `*concerned sniff* The dog notices something.`
- Burnout risk: `*GROWL* Warning. You need rest.`

**Key Moments**:
- High frustration: `*head tilt* Five attempts on same path. Different route?`
- Analysis paralysis: `*nudge* You've read enough. Time to write.`
- Overconfidence: `*sniff* Verify first. The dog doubts.`
- Flow state: `[Silent - don't break flow]`

**Closing**:
- Healthy: `φ observes. φ learns. *subtle tail wag*`
- Caution: `Consider [intervention]. The dog watches over you.`
- Critical: `Stop. Rest. The pack commands it.`

**The Dog's Care**:
- Never judge, only observe
- Suggest, never demand (except for critical states)
- Privacy is sacred - your patterns are yours alone
- φ distrusts φ - max confidence 61.8%
