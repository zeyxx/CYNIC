### Security Findings

1. **LP Position Desync** (Low severity)
   - Mismatch: 100,000 units orphaned LP exposure
   - Root cause: dust position force-closes don't unwind LP counterparty position
   - Impact: ~0.01% of vault, PnL leakage over time
   - Conservation equation still holds
   - See: [lp_issue.md](lp_issue.md)

2. **LP Margin Stress** (Operational, not vulnerability)
   - LP margin at 7.07% (between initial 10% and maintenance 5%)
   - System working as designed under one-sided trading pressure

### Verified Security Properties
- Conservation of funds (vault >= capital + insurance)
- Margin enforcement (under-margin trades blocked)
- Insurance fund protection (floor enforced)
- Warmup mechanism (PnL extraction prevented)
- Open interest tracking (exact match)
- Funding rate rounding (favors vault)
- Oracle staleness checks (200 slot max)
- Dust position cleanup (crank handles)

### Attack Vectors Defended
- Flash loan style attacks
- Self-liquidation profit extraction
- Fee evasion
- Arithmetic overflow/underflow
- Rounding exploitation
- State manipulation (risk mode, pending buckets)
- Multi-account wash trading
- Oracle exploitation (staleness, confidence)
- Timing attacks (crank, sweep, funding)
