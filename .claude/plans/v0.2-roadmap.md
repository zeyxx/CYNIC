# CYNIC v0.2 Roadmap

*"φ distrusts φ"* - κυνικός

**Goal**: Polish + Close critical gaps
**Status**: Planning

---

## Phase 1: Polish (Quality)

### P1.1 Fix Placeholders
- [ ] `packages/anchor/src/wallet.js:275` - Real ed25519 key derivation
- [ ] `packages/core/src/worlds/atzilut.js:86-104` - Real φ-alignment checks
- [ ] `packages/core/src/ecosystem/index.js:370` - Real external API fetch

### P1.2 More Examples
- [ ] `examples/judgment-flow.mjs` - Judge → PoJ → Proof
- [ ] `examples/dog-routing.mjs` - KabbalisticRouter demo
- [ ] `examples/pattern-detection.mjs` - PatternDetector demo
- [ ] `examples/mcp-server.mjs` - MCP server standalone

### P1.3 npm Publish Ready
- [ ] Add `exports` field to root package.json
- [ ] Remove `private: true` or publish workspace packages
- [ ] Add `.npmignore` files
- [ ] Test `npm pack` for each package

## Phase 2: Memory Gap (40% → 80%)

### M2.1 Cross-Session Fact Injection
- [x] SessionStart hook injects relevant past facts
- [x] Semantic search for context-relevant memories
- [x] Configurable injection limit (default: 50 facts)

**Implementation:**
- `awaken.js` queries FactsRepository for user/project facts
- `observe.js` extracts facts via FactExtractor to PostgreSQL
- Environment vars: `CYNIC_FACT_INJECTION_LIMIT`, `CYNIC_FACT_MIN_CONFIDENCE`

### M2.2 Real Vector Search
- [ ] pgvector integration (PostgreSQL extension)
- [ ] HNSW index for fast similarity search
- [ ] Fallback to TF-IDF when pgvector unavailable

### M2.3 4-Tier Memory Hierarchy
- [ ] Working Memory - Active task focus
- [ ] Episodic Memory - Complete interaction records
- [ ] Semantic Memory - Factual knowledge
- [ ] Vector Memory - Dense representations

---

## Phase 3: Learning Gap (20% → 60%)

### L3.1 Q-Learning Router Enhancement
- [ ] QLearningRouter already exists - wire to production
- [ ] Track success/failure outcomes
- [ ] Update Q-values based on feedback

### L3.2 EWC++ (Elastic Weight Consolidation)
- [ ] Prevent catastrophic forgetting
- [ ] Protect important learned patterns
- [ ] Fisher information matrix tracking

### L3.3 Performance-Based Self-Modification
- [ ] Track judgment accuracy over time
- [ ] Auto-adjust scorer weights based on feedback
- [ ] Self-correction loop

---

## Phase 4: Orchestration Gap (30% → 60%)

### O4.1 Swarm Intelligence
- [ ] CRDT for conflict-free distributed state
- [ ] Anti-drift mechanisms
- [ ] Consensus voting between Dogs

### O4.2 Background Workers
- [ ] Auto-dispatch workers for long tasks
- [ ] Worker pool management
- [ ] Progress tracking

---

## Phase 5: Vector Search Gap (30% → 70%)

### V5.1 Hyperbolic Embeddings
- [ ] Poincaré ball model for hierarchy
- [ ] Better representation of Tree of Life structure
- [ ] Faster nearest-neighbor in hyperbolic space

### V5.2 HNSW Optimization
- [ ] Already have basic HNSW - optimize parameters
- [ ] Benchmark against RuVector
- [ ] Auto-tuning based on data size

## Success Metrics

| Metric | v0.1 | v0.2 Target |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Memory & Persistence | 40% | 80% |
| Agent Orchestration | 30% | 60% |
| Learning & Adaptation | 20% | 60% |
| Vector Search | 30% | 70% |
| Examples | 1 | 5+ |
| Placeholders | 6 | 0 |

## Notes

- Twitter/X integration in progress (autre session)
- Keep tests at 100% pass rate
- Max confidence remains φ⁻¹ = 61.8%

*"Loyal to truth, not to comfort"*
