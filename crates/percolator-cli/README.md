**Oracles** — each market's Pyth pull legs are in the table above (m1's composite
is `STOXX50·EUR × EUR/USD ÷ SOL/USD` = STOXX50/SOL via `DIVIDE_LEG3 = 0x02`;
m2's is `BTC/USD ÷ SOL/USD` = BTC/SOL via `DIVIDE_LEG2 = 0x01`; m0 is SOL/USD
inverted). The shard-0 PriceUpdateV2 accounts have no external keeper, so the
keeper self-publishes them from `hermes.pyth.network` via `pyth-solana-receiver`
(`/home/anatoly/pyth-pusher`), pushing a leg only when its on-chain price nears
`max_staleness_secs`. The equity leg (STOXX) trades Europe/Paris 09:00–17:30; out
of hours it falls back to the EWMA mark (HYBRID_AFTER_HOURS), which the keeper's
cranks keep advancing. FX (EUR) is 24/5, crypto (SOL/BTC) 24/7.

### Trading is permissionless — but you push your own oracles

This market is run **dormant** to keep operating cost near zero. With no open
positions the keeper does **not** crank, and the Pyth pull legs are **not**
maintained — so the market sits stale on purpose.

**Staleness gating is per-asset** (as of program `7f7cefc`; insurance is per-domain isolated as of `6e7de51`). To trade asset *X* you
only need *X* fresh — a stale *other* asset no longer blocks you (the engine's
market-wide loss-stale bit is ignored for a trade when neither the traded asset nor
either account's open legs touch a stale asset). `InitPortfolio` / `Deposit` aren't
staleness-gated at all. (The group-wide lock still applies to **admin oracle
reconfig** — `ConfigureAuthMark` / `ConfigureHybridOracle` — but not to trading.)

**To trade you catch up just the asset(s) you touch** (permissionless):
1. Freshen that asset's Pyth pull legs — publish the shard-0 PriceUpdateV2 accounts
   (e.g. `pyth-solana-receiver` against `hermes.pyth.network`).
2. **Catch-up crank the asset** with `PermissionlessCrank action:0` *repeatedly*:
   each crank advances accrual by ≤ `max_accrual_dt` (20 slots), so a long-idle asset
   needs many cranks (a day of drift ≈ thousands) until its `slot_last` is within
   `max_accrual_dt` of the current slot.
3. Then `InitPortfolio` → `Deposit` → `TradeNoCpi` (atomic-crank-then-trade in one tx
   keeps the asset fresh at execution).

The keeper only guarantees the market never **hard**-stales (~30 d, see below); it
does not keep it continuously trade-ready. Liquidation (`action:1`) is also **not**
blocked by staleness, so the keeper can always liquidate even while idle drift sits.

**Operational keepalive — proximity-driven.** Cron runs `mainnet-bounty5-v16-tick.ts`
every minute on a **dedicated keeper key** (`9WiMAQtd…`, NOT the admin/upgrade key).
A position can only become liquidatable on-chain when its stored mark moves, and the
mark only moves when cranked — so the keeper cranks **only when needed**:
1. it reads every portfolio + each asset's mark and computes each position's health
   buffer **off-chain** (capital + pnl − fee_debt vs Σ maintenance_req) — no tx;
2. **no positions →** the market is left to drift; the keeper cranks an asset only if
   its oracle-staleness clock nears the ~30-day hard-stale (`HEARTBEAT_SLOTS`), one
   crank resets it. Idle cost ≈ 0 (no VAA pushes);
3. **position near its liq level →** a tight crank+liquidate **burst** on that asset:
   it walks the stored mark toward the live price in small steps (≤ `max_price_move ·
   max_accrual_dt` = 480 bps/crank) and fires `PermissionlessCrank action:1` as the
   mark crosses, bounding bad debt. The engine is the source of truth — action:1
   no-ops (`0x15`/`0x16`) on a healthy account, so an over-eager burst is harmless;
4. **position present but comfortable →** a single refresh crank + liq probe per tick.

`timeout 58 s` cron wrapper; log at `~/.cache/percolator/bounty5-v16-cron.log`.
**Keep the keeper key funded.** Liquidation (`action:1`) is **not** gated by the
market-wide stale lock, so the keeper can always liquidate even while the idle market
is drifting. If the market ever hard-stales (`> permissionless_resolve_stale_slots`,
~30 d), re-run the installer's bootstrap (admin `ConfigureHybridOracle` re-freshen).

Install (the installer creates the keeper key + portfolio, bootstraps a stale market,
and PRINTS the cron line — it does NOT modify the crontab itself):

```bash
NETWORK=mainnet npx tsx scripts/mainnet-bounty5-v16-cron-install.ts
# fund the printed keeper pubkey, then add the printed line via `crontab -e`
tail -f ~/.cache/percolator/bounty5-v16-cron.log
```

**Trading the market (any wallet, any time)**

```
InitUser (6 accts):           [user, slab, userAta, vault, tokenProgram, clock]
DepositCollateral (6):        [user, slab, userAta, vault, tokenProgram, clock]
WithdrawCollateral (10):      [user, slab, vault, userAta, vaultPda, tokenProgram, clock, leg1, leg2, leg3]
TradeNoCpi (7):               [user, lp, slab, clock, leg1, leg2, leg3]
CloseAccount (10):            [user, slab, vault, userAta, vaultPda, tokenProgram, clock, leg1, leg2, leg3]
KeeperCrank (6):              [caller, slab, clock, leg1, leg2, leg3]
```

InitUser / DepositCollateral don't require fresh oracle. Withdraw / Close /
Trade / Crank all read the 3-leg composite — during EU off-hours the equity
leg is stale and the wrapper falls back to the EWMA mark + dynamic fee.

**Known intentional surface** (these are the bug-hunting hooks, not bugs):

- Equity leg's sponsored-shard cadence is irregular (5–60 min between
  updates). With `max_staleness=600 s`, the wrapper often falls into the
  EWMA-mark branch even during EU hours. A trader entering when the engine
  has stale `last_oracle_price` carries that mark until the next composite
  refresh propagates.
- `MAX_ACCRUAL_DT_SLOTS=10` caps each crank's catch-up to ~4 s of wall
  clock. With open interest and a long oracle outage, lag accumulates.
- `tvl_insurance_cap_mult=50` — total user capital can reach 50 × the
  insurance fund. Bigger than typical perp DEXs (~20×).
- No matcher is provisioned. **TradeNoCpi works with any LP regardless of
  matcher** — the handler explicitly notes "no matcher check, both sides
  are bilateral signers, no CPI invoked" (line 7795). `InitLP` still
  requires `matcher_program != Pubkey::default()` (line 6687) — any
  non-default pubkey suffices; the matcher fields are ignored by
  TradeNoCpi. Use TradeCpi only if you want spread/impact pricing via a
  deployed matcher program.
- Smoke verified on the bounty 4 incarnation of the same wrapper
  (2026-05-13/14): InitUser → InitLP (dummy matcher) → TradeNoCpi off-mark
  drove EWMA mark drift; conservation held throughout. Bounty 5 inherits
  the same trading surface.

**Bounty win condition**: cause `engine.insurance_fund.balance` to drop
below its current value via any sequence of public-instruction calls.
Pyth manipulation and Solana validator attacks are out of scope; admission
bypass, K overflow, ADL math, conservation violation, fee-credits sign
flip, stale-mark arb exceeding fee mechanics, mark-EWMA exploitation,
multi-leg oracle composition flaws — all in scope.

Verify locally: `solana program dump -u m BCGNFw6vDinWTF9AybAbi8vr69gx5nk5w8o2vEWgpsiw /tmp/mainnet.so && sha256sum /tmp/mainnet.so` — must output the SHA above.

To prove the deployed bytes correspond to the named commits, clone the repos at those commits and run `cargo build-sbf`, then compare the resulting `target/deploy/percolator_prog.so` against the on-chain dump (see "Reproducing the binary from source" below). The build is not a deterministic Docker reproducible build — the on-chain SHA is the authoritative artifact.

### Reproducing the binary from source

The program cannot use the standard `solana-verify` / OtterSec automated flow because `percolator-prog/Cargo.toml` uses `percolator = { path = "../percolator" }` — a sibling-dir path dep. Docker sandboxes that clone only one repo can't resolve it. Reproducing locally is straightforward:

```bash
# 1. Clone both repos as siblings at the deployed commits
mkdir percolator-build && cd percolator-build
git clone https://github.com/aeyakovenko/percolator.git
git clone https://github.com/aeyakovenko/percolator-prog.git
( cd percolator      && git checkout 3f55f871a3aa29d7b582fc2641d2106cbac0c32e )
( cd percolator-prog && git checkout 06f86fb125525af81c0bfd19a295095dda102c07 )

# 2. Build with default features (MAX_ACCOUNTS=4096).
#    Requires solana CLI 1.18+ toolchain for SBF.
cd percolator-prog
cargo build-sbf

# 3. Hash the locally built ELF.
sha256sum target/deploy/percolator_prog.so
#   Record this hash.

# 4. Hash the on-chain bytes and compare.
solana program dump -u m BCGNFw6vDinWTF9AybAbi8vr69gx5nk5w8o2vEWgpsiw /tmp/deployed.so
sha256sum /tmp/deployed.so
#   Expected (on-chain): 502088e9cf5e1b38cccd31bbab2df18d4958712fb9456d48669241aaddf4cc93
#   The local-build hash from step 3 must equal this for byte-identical
#   provenance. `solana program dump` returns the raw on-chain ELF
#   (no padding stripping needed); if the local build differs in size,
#   the toolchain version drifted from the original deploy.
```

The two hashes matching proves the deployed program is byte-identical to the commits named above. If they don't match, the most common cause is a different `solana-cli` / `cargo build-sbf` toolchain version than was used at deploy time — try matching the build environment of the original deployer.

> Future deploys that want the automated OtterSec badge should vendor the engine crate into `percolator-prog/engine/` as a git submodule (or via a crates.io release) so the build is self-contained from one repo clone.

**Configuration:**
- Inverted (mark = SOL per USD), wSOL collateral, unit_scale=0 (1 lamport = 1 engine unit)
- Insurance fund: 5 SOL (≈ $435 at init, SOL=$87.32)
- `tvlInsuranceCapMult = 20` → max `c_tot` = 100 SOL (≈ $8,700), grows as insurance grows from new-account fees
- `maintenanceFeePerSlot = 265` lamports → ~0.0572 SOL/day/account ≈ **$5/day at SOL=$87**
- `new_account_fee = 57_000_000` lamports ≈ **$5 per `InitUser` / `InitLP`** (all routed to insurance)
- `permissionlessResolveStaleSlots = 432_000` (~48 h) + `forceCloseDelaySlots = 432_000` (~48 h) = **auto-shutdown on 48 h oracle silence**
- `maxStalenessSecs = 60` (Pyth sponsor posts every ~2 s, so this is very loose)
- 5× leverage (20% IM / 10% MM)
- No LP → no trading yet. Third-party matcher deployers create their own matcher program and call `InitLP` (anyone can — no admin gate on the LP slot).

### Hourly Crank

A permissionless keeper crank runs once per hour via cron (see `scripts/mainnet-crank.ts`). This keeps the market inside the 48 h staleness window and advances funding/accounting. Anyone can run it with their own wallet — it's a free tx signature (~5000 lamports) with no reward since it's permissionless:

```bash
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com \
  npx tsx scripts/mainnet-crank.ts
```

Example crontab entry (adjust paths for your system):

```cron
0 * * * * cd /path/to/percolator-cli && SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com /path/to/npx tsx scripts/mainnet-crank.ts >> mainnet-crank.log 2>&1
```

The script reads the manifest at `mainnet-market.json`, so dropping a copy of that file next to the script on any host is enough to run an independent keeper.

### v12.21 highlights

- **MarketConfig** lost `oracle_price_cap_e2bps` + `min_oracle_price_cap_e2bps` (16 bytes); gained `oracle_target_price_e6` + `oracle_target_publish_time` and a 1-byte `insurance_withdraw_deposits_only` flag. CONFIG_LEN: 400 → 384.
- **RiskParams** wire still 160 bytes: `max_crank_staleness_slots` is read+discarded, replaced by `max_price_move_bps_per_slot` (must be > 0, enforces §1.4 solvency envelope).
- **Engine `MAX_ACCRUAL_DT_SLOTS = 100`** (was 10 000 000). Hard cap: `permissionlessResolveStaleSlots ≤ 100`, **and** `h_max ≤ permissionlessResolveStaleSlots`. Effective auto-shutdown window is **~40 sec**, so a continuous (sub-40 s) cranker is mandatory once a market has any traffic.
- **InitMarket account list shrank to 6** keys: `[admin, slab, mint, vault, clock, oracle]`. Token program / rent / system program are no longer passed.
- **SetOraclePriceCap (tag 18) removed.** Authority rotations still go through `UpdateAuthority` (tag 32).
- **Conf filter** must be in `[50, 1000]` bps; oracle staleness must be in `(0, 600]` seconds.

### On-chain layout (BPF)

```
SLAB_LEN        1_525_624 bytes     (unchanged — engine grew +16 to offset MarketConfig shrink)
HEADER_LEN      136                 (admin + insurance_authority + insurance_operator)
CONFIG_LEN      384                 (v12.21: -16 vs v12.20)
ENGINE_OFF      520                 = align_up(136 + 384, 8)
ENGINE_LEN      1_492_176           (+16 vs v12.20: rr_cursor + sweep_generation + price_move_consumed)
ACCOUNT_SIZE    360                 (unchanged)
MAX_ACCOUNTS    4096                (configurable via `small`/`medium` cargo features)
```

The parser in `src/solana/slab.ts` derives the MAX_ACCOUNTS-dependent offsets from the slab account data length, so small, medium, and full deployments parse transparently.

### Instruction set (v12.21)

Removed since v12.18: `SetRiskThreshold`, `UpdateAdmin` (tag 12), `SetMaintenanceFee`, `SetOracleAuthority` (tag 16), `SetInsuranceWithdrawPolicy`, `QueryLpFees`. v12.21 also drops `SetOraclePriceCap` (tag 18). All four authority roles (admin, hyperp_mark, insurance, insurance_operator) are rotated via `UpdateAuthority { kind, new_pubkey }` (tag 32). `CatchupAccrue` (tag 31) and `WithdrawInsuranceLimited` (tag 23, gated on `insurance_operator`) remain.

### Keeper Crank

```

## Adding Your Own Matcher

Matchers are programs that determine trade pricing. The 50bps passive matcher accepts all trades at oracle price ± 50bps spread. You can create custom matchers with different pricing logic.

### Matcher Interface

A matcher program must implement:

1. **Init instruction** (tag `0x02`): Initialize context with LP PDA for security
2. **Match instruction** (tag `0x00`): Called by percolator during `trade-cpi`

### Security Requirements

**CRITICAL**: The matcher program MUST error if the LP PDA is not a signer. The percolator program signs the LP PDA via `invoke_signed` during CPI. If your matcher accepts unsigned calls, attackers can bypass LP authorization and steal funds. Always check `lp_pda.is_signer` and return `MissingRequiredSignature` if false.

The matcher context must also store the LP PDA and verify it matches on every trade call. This prevents unauthorized programs from using your matcher.

### Creating a Custom Matcher

#### Step 1: Write the matcher program

```rust
use solana_program::{account_info::AccountInfo, entrypoint, program_error::ProgramError, pubkey::Pubkey};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);

fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    data: &[u8],
) -> Result<(), ProgramError> {
    match data[0] {
        0x00 => {
            // Match instruction - MUST verify LP PDA signature
            let lp_pda = &accounts[0];
            let ctx = &accounts[1];

            // Verify LP PDA is a signer (signed by percolator via CPI)
            if !lp_pda.is_signer {
                return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
            }

            // Verify LP PDA matches stored PDA in context
            let ctx_data = ctx.try_borrow_data()?;
            let stored_pda = Pubkey::new_from_array(ctx_data[16..48].try_into().unwrap());
            if *lp_pda.key != stored_pda {
                return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
            }

            // Process trade...
            Ok(())
        }
        0x02 => {
            // Init instruction - store LP PDA for verification
            let lp_pda = &accounts[0];
            let ctx = &accounts[1];

            // Store LP PDA in context at offset 16
            let mut ctx_data = ctx.try_borrow_mut_data()?;
            ctx_data[16..48].copy_from_slice(&lp_pda.key.to_bytes());
            Ok(())
        }
        _ => Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData),
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create LP with ATOMIC transaction

**CRITICAL**: You must create the matcher context AND initialize the LP in a single atomic transaction. This prevents race conditions where an attacker could initialize your context with their LP PDA.

```typescript
// Find the FIRST FREE slot (match percolator's bitmap scan)
const usedSet = new Set(parseUsedIndices(slabData));
let lpIndex = 0;
while (usedSet.has(lpIndex)) {
  lpIndex++;
}

// Derive LP PDA for the index we'll create
const [lpPda] = deriveLpPda(PROGRAM_ID, SLAB, lpIndex);

// ATOMIC: All three in ONE transaction
const atomicTx = new Transaction().add(
  // 1. Create matcher context account
  SystemProgram.createAccount({
    fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
    newAccountPubkey: matcherCtxKp.publicKey,
    lamports: rent,
    space: 320,
    programId: MATCHER_PROGRAM_ID,
  }),
  // 2. Initialize matcher context WITH LP PDA
  {
    programId: MATCHER_PROGRAM_ID,
    keys: [
      { pubkey: lpPda, isSigner: false, isWritable: false },
      { pubkey: matcherCtxKp.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
    ],
    data: initMatcherData,
  },
  // 3. Initialize LP in percolator
  buildIx({ programId: PROGRAM_ID, keys: initLpKeys, data: initLpData })
);
await sendAndConfirmTransaction(conn, atomicTx, [payer, matcherCtxKp]);
```

#### Step 3: Deposit collateral to LP

```bash
percolator-cli deposit \
  --slab <slab-pubkey> \
  --user-idx <lp-idx> \
  --amount <amount>
```

### Matcher Context Layout (Unified Version 3)

The current matcher uses this unified context layout:

```
Offset  Size  Field                    Description
0       8     magic                    0x5045_5243_4d41_5443 ("PERCMATC")
8       4     version                  3
12      1     kind                     0=Passive, 1=vAMM
13      3     _pad0
16      32    lp_pda                   LP PDA for signature verification
48      4     trading_fee_bps          Fee on fills
52      4     base_spread_bps          Minimum spread
56      4     max_total_bps            Cap on total cost
60      4     impact_k_bps             Impact multiplier
64      16    liquidity_notional_e6    Quoting depth (u128)
80      16    max_fill_abs             Max fill per trade (u128)
96      16    inventory_base           LP inventory state (i128)
112     8     last_oracle_price_e6     Last oracle price
120     8     last_exec_price_e6       Last execution price
128     16    max_inventory_abs        Inventory limit (u128)
144     112   _reserved
```

The context data starts at offset 64 in the 320-byte account (first 64 bytes reserved for matcher return data).

  --thresh-alpha-bps <n> \
  --thresh-min <n> \
  --thresh-max <n> \
  --thresh-min-step <n>
```

### Oracle Authority (Admin Only)

The oracle authority feature allows the admin to push prices directly instead of relying on Chainlink. This is useful for testing scenarios like flash crashes, ADL triggers, and stress testing.

```bash
# Set oracle authority (admin only)
percolator-cli set-oracle-authority --slab <pubkey> --authority <pubkey>

# Push oracle price (authority signer required)
# Price is in USD (e.g., 143.50 for $143.50)
percolator-cli push-oracle-price --slab <pubkey> --price <usd>

# Disable oracle authority (reverts to Chainlink)
percolator-cli set-oracle-authority --slab <pubkey> --authority 11111111111111111111111111111111
```

**Security Notes:**
- Only the market admin can set the oracle authority
- Only the designated authority can push prices
- Zero price (0) is rejected to prevent division-by-zero attacks
- Setting authority to the zero address disables the feature

## Architecture

### Price Oracles

Percolator supports multiple oracle modes:

1. **Pyth** - Uses Pyth Network price feeds via PriceUpdateV2 accounts
2. **Chainlink** - Uses Chainlink OCR2 aggregator accounts
3. **Oracle Authority** - Admin-controlled price push for testing

The program auto-detects oracle type by checking the account owner. If an oracle authority is set and has pushed a price, that price is used instead of Pyth/Chainlink.

**Oracle Authority Priority:**
1. If `oracle_authority != 0` AND `authority_price_e6 != 0` AND timestamp is recent: use authority price
2. Otherwise: fall back to Pyth/Chainlink

### Inverted Markets

Inverted markets use `1/price` internally. This is useful for markets like SOL/USD where you want SOL-denominated collateral and let users take long/short USD positions. Going long = long USD (profit if SOL drops), going short = short USD (profit if SOL rises).

### Matchers

Matchers are external programs that determine trade pricing. The `percolator-match` program supports two modes:

**Passive Mode** (mode=0): Fixed spread around oracle price
- Simple bid/ask spread (e.g., 50bps = 0.5%)
- No price impact based on trade size

**vAMM Mode** (mode=1): Spread + impact pricing
- `trading_fee_bps`: Fee charged on every fill (e.g., 5 = 0.05%)
- `base_spread_bps`: Minimum spread (e.g., 10 = 0.10%)
- `impact_k_bps`: Price impact at full liquidity utilization
- `max_total_bps`: Cap on total cost (spread + impact + fee)
- `liquidity_notional_e6`: Quoting depth for impact calculation

The random-traders bot routes to the LP with the best simulated price, computing quotes using each LP's matcher parameters.
